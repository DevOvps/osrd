/**
 * <p>A data structure meant to store the immutable part of a railroad infrastructure.</p>
 *
 * <p>It has a somewhat uncommon data model, closer to graph theory than other railway simulators:</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Edges are pieces of tracks</li>
 *  <li>Nodes are intersection points between edges</li>
 *  <li>All elements that do not change the shape of the railway infrastructure are <b>attributes</b> along edges</li>
 *  <li>Each edge has a direction, and stores arrays of attributes</li>
 *  <li>Edges can belong to one or more tracks, which are a collection of edges.</li>
 *  <li>Tracks can be part of a line</li>
 *  <li>Block sections are an entirely separate graph</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h1>Building a topological graph</h1>
 * <p>A topological graph is a special kind of graph, where there can't be a
 * node that changes the shape of the graph. For example, the following graph:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *  a       b     c
 *   +------+----+
 *   |           |
 *   +-----------+
 *  d             e
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Isn't a topological graph, as the shape of the graph wouldn't change if {@code b}
 * weren't here. The issue can be fixed by removing the excess node, and storing the associated
 * data, such as slope, the position of a section signal, or a speed limit, into an attribute
 * of the new edge.</p>
 *
 * <p>There an edge case where a seemingly useless node should be preserved: sometimes,
 * a line has two names (or identifiers), and there needs to be a node to model this, as each
 * edge can only be on a single line.</p>
 *
 * <h1>Block sections</h1>
 * <p>Block sections are sections of track delimited by section signals. Unlike the topology graph,
 * the block section graph is kind of directed: where you can go depends on the edge you're coming
 * from. Consider the following example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *             s b
 *            /
 *   a s-----=----s c
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>Each {@code s} is a signal delimiting block sections, and the {@code =} is a switch.
 * Because of the way switches work, you can't go from {@code b} to {@code c}, nor from
 * {@code c} to {@code b}, even though any other path would work.</p>
 *
 * <p>We decided to model it using <b>per-edge neighbours</b>: each end of the block section
 * can be connected to other block sections, even though it's also connected to a signal.</p>
